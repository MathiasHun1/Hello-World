# Who am I?

I am an **ex-motorcycle mechanic** and an ex **professional poker player** from Hungary, switcing career to web development. <br>
The reasons I switch to web dev: <br>
-I am a tipycal problem solver type. I always had a passion to know why things work, and how they works.  
-I like to work on computer, I did that when I was a poker player for years, 8-12 hours/day.  
-Because of online poker, I did some programming (eg. creating my own Hud stats in a software, to analyze the opponents statistics in specific scenarios) and I liked it very much.  
-Despite I love motorcycles, and ran my own motorcycle mechanic business for years, sadly I didn't like that lifestyle. I was always phisically exhausted by the end of the day,
tired of the whole business, the chineese sh*tbag bikes and spare parts, and the endless list of that kind of problems.  
-I like learning new things and its not a problem for me at all, so programming seems to be a really good choice.
